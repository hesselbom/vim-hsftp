vim-hsftp
=========

Vim: Upload and download files through sftp

Usage:
------
First you have to create a config file called .hsftp in your project directory.

When uploading/downloading hsftp searches backwards for a config file so if the edited file is e.g. `/test/dir/file.txt` and the config file is `/test/.hsftp` it will upload/download as `dir/file.txt`

The config file should be structured like this (amount of spaces doesn't matter):

    host   1.1.1.1
    user   username
    pass   test123
    port   22
    remote /var/www/
    confirm_download 0
    confirm_upload 0

### Commands
    :Hdownload

    :Hupload

    :Hupdir

    :Hdowndir
